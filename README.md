# Pandas-Data-Analysis-Tasks

Used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. 
The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. 

1. We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include dropping rows with NaN values, changing data type of columns depending on requirement,
adding or removing a column

2. Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move to data exploration. In this we try to analyse data for getting answers to some of the questions like highest
selling products,cities with high sales, months and time of highest sale,etc.

3. Lastly plotted bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results using pandas and matplotlib methods.
